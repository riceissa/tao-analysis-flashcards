    <h1>Tao Analysis Flashcards</h1>
    <p>Welcome! This website provides spaced repetition flashcards for Terence
    Tao's <i>Analysis I</i>, via <a href="https://withorbit.com/">Orbit</a>.
    Flashcards look like this:</p>
    <orbit-reviewarea color="red">
      <orbit-prompt
        question="Who is the author of _Analysis I_?"
        answer="Terence Tao"
      ></orbit-prompt>
    </orbit-reviewarea>
    <p>Orbit was intended to be used for online writing so that the reader can
    do the flashcards as they are reading the text. Since <i>Analysis I</i> was
    not written as an online text with embedded flashcards, the flashcards must
    be hosted externally on this site. That means that you, the reader, will
    need to do a little bit of extra work to remember to come back to this site
    after reading each section of the book. The outline below is to help you know when to
    do which set of flashcards. After you do a set of flashcards, reminder
    emails will be sent to you so you will not need to keep visiting this
    site.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>After reading section 2.1: <a href="sections/2.1.html">2.1</a>, <a href="sections/peano-axioms.html">Peano axioms</a> (optional)</li>
    </ul>
