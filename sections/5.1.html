      <h1>Section 5.1</h1>
      <p>Section 5.1 begins the construction of the real numbers by introducing sequences, and by defining the notions of Cauchy sequence and bounded sequence.</p>
      <p>The definition of Cauchy sequence has three nested quantifiers ("for every &hellip; there exists &hellip; for every &hellip;") and may seem like a lot. But this definition is so important that I recommend memorizing it fully (but make sure you also understand it!).</p>

        <orbit-prompt
          question="If a sequence is finite, is it necessarily Cauchy?"
          answer="Yes (given any $\varepsilon > 0$, just pick $N$ as the final index of the sequence; then for all $j,k \geq N$ we have $|a_j - a_k| = |a_N - a_N| = 0 < \varepsilon$)

This turns out to not be a very interesting thought, since the notion of Cauchy sequences was introduced to talk about limits, and limiting behavior is only interesting when there are an infinite number of elements in the sequence. But it is still good practice to test ideas like this even in situations for which they were not originally intended."
